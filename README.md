This GitHub repository contains code for Emotion detection using the ResNet50 model architecture which is pretrained on imagenet dataset, which has been further fine-tuned on our dataset.Along with this we have used other model architecture also like VGG16 and a simple CNN model. You can download the dataset from Kaggle using this link. Additionally, the repository includes code for a Streamlit application to deploy our model, along with the saved model. Also Provided the requirements file which lists all the required files and dependencies.

The Streamlit app also features a live video capturing and emotion detection feature along with this option to give an image.

Feel free to contribute to this project by creating pull requests or reporting issues. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
